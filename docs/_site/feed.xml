Roothaert. This webpage showcases my projects, which are mostly related to AI, XAI, hybrid AI and  ML. The preferred programming language used is Python, although some projects are written java and scala. Please get in touch  with me at h.m.roothaert@gmail.com if you intend on using one of my projects for personal use.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Bachelors Project</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/update/2022/09/13/Wildfire.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bachelors Project" /><published>2022-09-13T15:48:14+02:00</published><updated>2022-09-13T15:48:14+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/portfolio/update/2022/09/13/Wildfire</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/update/2022/09/13/Wildfire.html">&lt;p&gt;For my bachelors project, I used reinforcement learning to train an
agent in controlling forest fires. In order to do so, me and three other
 students from the University of Groningen build a forest fire simulation 
and implemented several reinforcement learning techniques. My main 
contributions were the agent implementations and the connectionist monte-
Carlo algorithm inplementation. The final grade awarded to this project 
was a 7.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ritten11/Wildfire-Control&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of 
running instructions and proper documentation, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/21637/&quot;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; might 
be more informative&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ritten Roothaert</name></author><category term="portfolio" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">For my bachelors project, I used reinforcement learning to train an agent in controlling forest fires.

which allows the user to optimize the seed selection for creating hybrid 
pumpkin seeds. The application uses knowledge provided by organic seeds 
breeder “De Bolster”, to determine the phenotype of the child plant after 
breeding with two parents plants. The current version is a demo version 
based on mock data, but has been validated by an expert breeder. The 
program could therefore be used as a useful tool for any pumpkin breeder 
once real data is fed into the application. The final project was awarded 
with an 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ritten11/Pumpkin-Drools-Public&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, along with running 
instructions. The source code has not been made available at the request
of the experts involved in making this application.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ritten Roothaert</name></author><category term="portfolio" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">One of my first projects was the ProSeed Seed Selector, which is a tool which allows the user to optimize the seed selection for creating hybrid pumpkin seeds.
