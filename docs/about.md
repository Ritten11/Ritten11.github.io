Hi, 

I am Ritten, an AI-researcher with a diverse skill set. My drive is to 
find solutions to complex problems using custom build AI applications, 
with a special interest in the agricultural and biology domains. 

During my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen, I 
encountered subjects such as machine learning, logic, knowledge systems,
cognitive psychology, neuro-ergonomics, microbiology and atmospheric modeling. 


### Programming skills
My preferred programming languages are Python and Java, but am also 
acquainted with R, Lisp and C. 

### Languages
I can speak both English and Dutch fluently, and understand German and Norwegian.


### Personality
Personality traits I would bring to a professional team are: team-oriented 
competitiveness, unconventional thinking and the ability to quickly 
understand new concepts.


### Notable accomplishments
Furthermore, I'm always eager to learn about fields outside of his main 
expertise and look for ways on how to implement my skill set to these 
fields. This has been demonstrated by various projects, one of which 
being the iGEM competition. The iGEM competition is a competition where 
teams from across the world aim to use molecular microbiology to solve 
real-world problems. Without much background knowledge about the field 
of microbiology, I have managed to build an ML-model which was 
eventually nominated for 'best model' award in the overgraduate category. 
Other contributions to the team were human practice work and being the 
financial manager of the team. As icing on the cake, we even won the 
'best environmental project' award, also within the overgraduate category!
