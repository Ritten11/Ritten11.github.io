<!-- excerpt-start -->
A lot happened in the year 2020. A massive increase in hospital admissions due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandamic put a substantial strain on the dutch healthcare system, resulting in unpresidented measures being taken to slow the spreading of the virus. One of those measures was enforced social distancing within the dutch public transport, including the train network. Me and three other students at the University of Groningen deceded to test the effectiveness of this social distancing method, and wanted to see wether we could improve upon the current strategy by implementing different seating arrangements and boarding strategies. We did so using a multi-agent system approach, in which we modelled the train route from The Hage central station to Groningen central station. The code of the simulation can be found on our [github repository][github-page], and the results are given in [our report][report]. The final grade was an 8.
