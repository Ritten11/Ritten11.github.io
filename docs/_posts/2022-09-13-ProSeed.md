One of my first projects was the ProSeed Seed Selector, which is a tool 
which allows the user to optimize the seed selection for creating hybrid 
pumpkin seeds. The application uses knowledge provided by organic seeds 
breeder "De Bolster", to determine the phenotype of the child plant after 
breeding with two parents plants. The current version is a demo version 
based on mock data, but has been validated by an expert breeder. The 
program could therefore be used as a useful tool for any pumpkin breeder 
once real data is fed into the application. The final project was awarded 
with an 8
 
The application can be found [here][proseed-page], along with running 
instructions. The source code has not been made available at the request
of the experts involved in making this application.
