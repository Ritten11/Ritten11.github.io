<!-- excerpt-start -->
For the course 'Logica Aspects of Multi-agent Systems (LAMaS)', me and two
fellow students modelled 'The Resistance' using epistemic logic. The 
Resistance is a multiplayer deductive reasoning role-playing game. Using 
a multi-agent based approach, we tested how the usage of higher-order 
knowledge could increase the win-rate of the agents. The [full report][website] 
and [implementation][github-page] are available online. The final grade 
for the project was a 9.
